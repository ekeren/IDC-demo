# Working Backwards

A meeting was scheduled with a director of engineering at ACME, their team is responsible for the EDA workloads.

Prior to the meeting, I received an email from our system that consolidated the usage of ACME developers with Wing.

We are being used by 5 different engineers, the BDR was already able to map them into the org. 3 of them are part of the same team, which reports to the director, 1 of them is an architect, and the last one, we don't know.
